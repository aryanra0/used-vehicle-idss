"""Feature engineering shared by training and serving (single-source schema).

Every feature is knowable before acquisition (no target leakage). The sale
`price` is the target and is never a feature. The Manheim MMR benchmark IS used
as a feature: it is an external market value published before the sale (not
derived from this row's sale price), and it is the single strongest predictor of
resale — excluding it is what made earlier estimates behave like guesses.

Only features the UI actually collects are used, so every input the user changes
moves the prediction (and its confidence).
